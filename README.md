🛒 Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover revenue drivers, purchasing patterns, customer loyalty, and subscription impact.
Using SQL, Python (Pandas), and Power BI, raw transactional data was transformed into actionable business insights that can support marketing, pricing, retention, and inventory decisions.

The goal was not just to visualize data, but to answer real business questions using structured analysis.

🎯 Business Questions Addressed

The analysis focused on answering the following key questions:

Which gender generates more revenue?

Do discounts attract high-value customers or only low spenders?

Which products have the highest customer satisfaction?

Does shipping type influence spending?

Do subscribed customers spend more than non-subscribers?

Which products rely heavily on discounts?

How loyal is the customer base?

What are the best-selling products in each category?

Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe?

Which age groups contribute the most revenue?

🧰 Tools & Technologies

SQL Server – Data querying and aggregation

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and exploration

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and storytelling

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis workflow and documentation

🔍 Analysis Approach
1. Data Preparation

Cleaned and validated data in Python

Handled categorical variables (gender, category, subscription status)

Verified data consistency before analysis

2. SQL Analysis

Key SQL techniques used:

GROUP BY and aggregation functions

Subqueries for benchmarking

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER)

Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Each query was designed to answer a specific business question, not just to explore data randomly.

3. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard presents insights through:

KPI cards (customers, revenue, ratings)

Revenue & unit sales by category

Age group performance

Subscription revenue contribution

Customer segmentation visuals

Gender and shipping behavior analysis

The dashboard allows stakeholders to filter and explore data interactively.

📊 Key Insights
Revenue & Sales

Clothing is the top-performing category in both revenue and units sold.

Accessories follow, while footwear and outerwear underperform.

Customer Demographics

Male customers generate more total revenue.

Young Adults and Middle-aged customers contribute the majority of revenue.

Discount Behavior

Discounts are used by both low and high spenders.

Certain products rely heavily on discounting, indicating price sensitivity.

Customer Loyalty

The majority of customers fall into the Loyal segment.

Repeat buyers are significantly more likely to be subscribers.

Subscriptions

Subscribers:

Do not spend more per order

Are more likely to return and repurchase

Subscriptions improve retention, not average order value.

Shipping Behavior

Customers choosing Express shipping spend slightly more on average.

Convenience plays a role in purchase value.

📈 Business Impact

This analysis demonstrates how data can:

Guide marketing targeting

Improve inventory planning

Optimize discount strategies

Support subscription model decisions

Strengthen customer retention strategies

🧠 Key Takeaway

The most valuable customers are not the biggest spenders — they are the ones who come back.

This project highlights the importance of understanding customer behavior beyond surface-level metrics.

🚀 Future Improvements

Cohort analysis for customer retention

Time-series analysis for seasonal trends

Predictive modeling for churn and lifetime value

Deeper basket analysis (cross-sell opportunities)
